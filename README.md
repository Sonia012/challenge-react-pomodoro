# Description

Beginning of April 2019. The purpose of this project was to create a pomodoro timer with a default value of 20 minutes that can be changed by "+" and "-" buttons. Both buttons should be inactive when the counter is counting down. The buttons only function when the counter has stopped. There's also a start button, which has to change into a "reset" button as soon as the timer is started.
